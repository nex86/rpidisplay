Updated install script for Watterott display with Raspbian Buster compatiblity

Just run with

curl https://github.com/nex86/rpidisplay/raw/master/rpi-display.sh | sudo bash X

while X is the orientation in degrees (clockwise). 

available degrees are 0, 90, 180 and 270. Mine worked with 270 for landscape mode.
